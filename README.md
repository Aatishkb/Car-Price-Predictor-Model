# Car-Price-Predictor-Model

## Introduction:

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction project repository! In this project, we aim to develop a robust machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the prices of cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition. Predicting car prices accurately is crucial for both buyers and sellers in the automotive market. Through this project, we leverage the power of machine learning algorithms to provide insightful predictions, aiding users in making informed decisions when buying or selling a car. This repository contains the codebase, datasets, and documentation detailing the development process and evaluation metrics of our prediction model. Join us on this journey towards enhancing decision-making in the automotive industry!
